- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wongdayou
- I am currently a 2nd year student at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) studying Computer Science.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and design and digital painting.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make 2d games using Unity and I am planning to learn Unity3D soon. I am also learning digital painting at the moment so that 
      I can create illustrations and sprites for my games.
